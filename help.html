        <h3>What are grounding systems?</h3>
        The grounding system describes different types of grounding in a low-voltage network in electrical engineering 

        <h3>Which grounding systems exists?</h3>
        Basically, there are three different forms of grounding:
        
        <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system#Types_of_TN_networks" target="_blank">TN network</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system#TT_network" target="_blank">TT network</a> and </li>
        <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system#IT_network" target="_blank">IT network</a></li>
        </ul>

        They differ in the type of grounding at the transformer's secondary terminals (operational grounding) and at the consumer's end (installation grounding). <br />
        Each system has its advantages and disadvantages and must be considered in the electrical installation in a building. Depending on the location and network operator, the network form may vary.

        <h3>What is a TT-System?</h3>
        In the TT-System (french: terre terre), the transformer neutral point is connected to the operational earth. All grounded parts in the building are not connected to the operational earth of the distribution network.

        <h3>What is a IT-System?</h3>
        In the IT-System (french: isol√© terre), the transformer neutral point is not grounded; there is only one grounding electrode for the installation. There is no galvanic connection between the phase conductors and grounded parts.

        <h3>What is a TN-System?</h3>
        In the TN-System (french: terre neutre), the operational earth of the transformer is connected to the grounding system of the building. All grounded parts in the building are connected to the operational earth of the distribution network. Additionally, the TN system is distinguished between TN-C, TN-C-S, and TN-S
