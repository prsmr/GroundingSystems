        <h3>Why does this project actually exists</h3>
        The initiator of the project works as an electrical engineer in the field of power engineering and is frequently dealing with the question of which grounding system is predominant in various locations. Therefore, he had the idea to compile this information on a map and make it publicly available.

        <h3>What are grounding systems</h3>
        The grounding system describes different types of grounding in a low-voltage network in electrical engineering 

        <h3>Which grounding systems exists?</h3>
        Basically, there are three different forms of grounding:
        
        <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system#Types_of_TN_networks" target="_blank">TN network</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system#TT_network" target="_blank">TT network</a> and </li>
        <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system#IT_network" target="_blank">IT network</a></li>
        </ul>

        They differ in the type of grounding at the transformer's secondary terminals (operational grounding) and at the consumer's end (installation grounding). <br />
        Each system has its advantages and disadvantages and must be considered in the electrical installation in a building. Depending on the location and network operator, the network form may vary.

        <h3>I want more information</h3>
        You're welcome.
