        <h3>Why does this project actually exists?</h3>
        The initiator of the project works as an electrical engineer in the field of power engineering and is frequently dealing with the question of which grounding system is predominant in various locations. Therefore, he had the idea to compile this information on a map and make it publicly available.

        <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
        You can improve the source code or design by contributing on GitHub. <br />
        You can also add some GeoJSON data for grid operators and the grounding system.
